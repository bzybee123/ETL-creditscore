# Data Cleaning & Preparation -creditscore

Data cleaning and preprocessing for credit risk modeling. Includes handling missing values, renaming columns, encoding categorical variables, mapping financial attributes, and preparing data for PD/LGD/EAD model development.

 **Project Objectives**

=>Explore raw credit risk dataset

=>Perform data cleaning: drop irrelevant columns, rename features, and fix missing values

=>Map business categories (employment length, savings status) into numerical values

=>Encode the target variable (good/bad → 1/0)

=>Convert selected variables into categorical data types

=>Make dataset ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling

**Tools & Libraries**

Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

**Key Insights**

=>Data cleaning is not just technical, it’s business translation:

=>Employment bands → numeric tenure

=>Savings brackets → representative amounts

=>Risk class → binary outcome (good/bad)

=>A clean dataset is the foundation of accurate credit risk models.
